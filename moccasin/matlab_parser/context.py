# The ContextDict class makes it easier to create dictionary-like properties
# on MatlabContext objects.  The reason it's necessary is that Python
# properties are designed around the idea that you do "obj.prop = value",
# whereas for some properties in MatlabContext, we want the ability to do
# "obj.prop[key] = value".  This means that obj.prop has to be a custom class
# that supports the operations.
#
# This next class def is based on http://stackoverflow.com/a/7760938/743730

class MatlabContext(object):
    """Class for tracking our interpretation of MATLAB parsing results.  Most
    properties of objects of this class are used to store things that are
    also in one of our annotated ParseResults structures, but designed to
    make it easier to access data that we need for our MATLAB translation
    purposes.  Some properties are things that aren't from ParseResults, such
    as a link to the parent context.

    The properties are:

      topmost:     Boolean; True if this is the topmost context in the file.

      name:        The name of this context.  If this context represents a
                   function definition, it will be the function name.  If this
                   is the topmost context, the name will be the name of the
                   first function defined in the file.

      parent:      The parent context object.  If this is the topmost context
                   in the file, this value will be None.

      nodes:       The parsed representation of the MATLAB code within this
                   context, expressed as a list of MatlabNode objects.  If this
                   context is a script file, then it's the list of statements in
                   the file; if it's a function, it's the list of statements in
                   the function's body.

      parameters:  If this is a function, a list of the parameters it takes.
                   The list will contain MatlabNode objects.

      returns:     If this is a function, its return values.  The list will
                   contain MatlabNode objects.

      functions:   A dictionary of functions defined within this context.  The
                   keys are the function names (as Identifier objects); the
                   values are MatlabContext objects for the functions.

      assignments: A dictionary of the assignment statements within this
                   context.  The keys are MatlabNode objects, such as
                   Identifier when the assignment is to a simple variable ("a
                   = ..."), Array when the assignment is to a bare matrix,
                   and so on.  The dictionary values are, for each key, the
                   MatlabNode object representing the root of the AST for the
                   expression on the right-hand side of the assignment.

      types:       A dictionary of data types associated with objects.  For
                   example, when MatlabParser encounters an assignment
                   statement or a function definition, it stores the
                   identifier of the assigned variable or parameter in this
                   dictionary and sets the value to 'variable', to distinguish
                   it from a 'function'.

      calls:       A dictionary of functions called within this context.  The
                   keys are the function names; the values is a list of the
                   arguments (as `MatlabNode` arguments representing the
                   expressions handed to the function invocation).

      pr:          The pr object related to this context.  This Context will
                   contain the stuff from which we constructed this instance
                   of a MatlabContext object.  The representation is awkward
                   and not meant to be used by callers, but it's left around
                   for debugging purposes.

      file:        If the contents of this context came from a file, the path
                   to the file.

    Users can access via the normal x.propname approach.

    To make a copy of a Context object, use the Python 'copy' module.

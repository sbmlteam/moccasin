# Guidelines for contributing to this project

Any constructive contributions &ndash; bug reports, pull requests (code or documentation), suggestions for improvements, and more &ndash; are welcome.

## Conduct

Everyone is asked to read and respect the [code of conduct](https://github.com/sbmlteam/moccasin/blob/master/CONDUCT.md) before participating in this project.

## Submitting contributions

Please feel free to post questions and suggestions to the MOCCASIN developers' discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/moccasin-dev), or even better, jump right in and use the standard GitHub approach of forking the repo and creating a pull request.  When committing code changes and submitting pull requests, please write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

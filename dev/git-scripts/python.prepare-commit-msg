# @file    prepare-commit-msg
# @brief   Git hook for Python code
# @author  Michael Hucka
# =============================================================================
#
# Purpose:
#
# This hook script runs pep8 on python files that are about to be committed.
# If pep8 reports anything, the report is inserted as comments into the
# commit message template.  This approach was the best that I could come up
# with in order to handle the following situation: if you use an editor like
# Emacs, and your commit message is thrown into an editing buffer, you may
# not see messages printed on stdout or stderr by the git commit command.  By
# putting the pep8 output into the commit message template, it helps ensure
# you see it before committing.
#
# Running pep8 is not something you want to do on a commit hook, because you
# may want to ignore pep8's warnings.  Using prepare-commit-msg, you can
# ignore the warnings by deleting the comments from the commit message.  (But
# of course, it's better to take the opportunity to go back and fix the issues
# before completing the commit.)
#
# Usage:
#
# To use this script, rename it to "prepare-commit-msg", copy it to the
# subdirectory ".git/hooks/" in your git repository, and make sure it is
# executable.
# =============================================================================

# Configurable variables. "IGNORE" is a comma-separated list of codes to
# be ignored. See http://pep8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes
# for an explanation of the codes.  The set of codes below reflects my personal
# preferences; yours may differ, so make sure to adjust this as you see fit.
#
# Rationale for ignoring these particular codes:
#
#   E221: multiple spaces before operators.  This rule unfortunately causes
#   aligned assignment statements to be flagged by `pep8`; that is, it flags
#   the case where you align the equals `=` signs for several assignments
#   across multiple lines.  The alignment is desirable because sometimes it
#   helps code readability.
#
#   E226: missing whitespace around operators.  If this rule is left in, then
#   `pep8` flags constructs such as `print(stuff + "-"*70)` because of the
#   lack of spaces around the `*`.  However, adding spaces in such cases
#   arguably makes the result _less_ easily understood.
#
#   E241: multiple spaces after a comma.  This again is a case where it flags
#   situations in which you may want to align code across multiple lines for
#   readability reasons.
#
#   E303: too many blank lines.  If you have more than one blank line
#   anywhere in your file, this will cause `pep8` to flag it.  This is
#   frankly ridiculous.  File readability is often enhanced by having more
#   than one line between parts of a file.
#
#   E501: line too long.  Sometimes it makes sense to let a line be longer
#   than 80 characters.

# Body of script.  No more configuration should be necessary after this point.
#
# Notes about the behavior: git's prepare-commit-msg hook is called by "git
# commit" with the name of the file that has the commit message, followed by
# the description of the commit message's source.  The source may be empty.
# The hook's purpose is to edit the commit message file.  If the hook fails
# with a non-zero status, the commit is aborted.  More info is available at
# http://git-scm.com/docs/githooks
#
# This script ignores the source argument and always runs, because I couldn't
# think of a reason not to do that (so far, anyway).

           MOCCASIN NEWS -- History of user-visible changes

====================================================================
1.2.0
====================================================================

There are two important changes in this release.  The first is a 
*massive* improvement to the speed of parsing MATLAB files compared
to recent performance.  The second is the elimination of the 
separate `moccasin_CLI` and `moccasin_GUI` entry points in favor of
a single program, `moccasin`, that can be used either to start the
GUI or perform actions via the command line. 

Bug fixes:

* [#49](https://github.com/sbmlteam/moccasin/issues/49) Fixed extreme
  slowness of MATLAB parser.

* [#46](https://github.com/sbmlteam/moccasin/issues/46) Moccasin
  GUI won't launch.


====================================================================
1.1.2
====================================================================

Release 1.1.2 fixes a bug that caused MOCCASIN to fail on some scripts
that did not have an enclosing function.  Issues resolved: #19, #20.


====================================================================
1.1.1
====================================================================

This release fixes compatibility issues with wxPython version 1.1.1.


====================================================================
1.1.0
====================================================================

This release features a major overhaul of the underlying MATLAB
parser, as well as a substantial rewrite of the SBML/XPP converter
code. The new system is much more robust in the face of a greater
range of MATLAB inputs, although the types of MATLAB models it
recognizes and can convert are still relatively limited.

The new MATLAB parser correctly parses much more of the MATLAB syntax,
thus eliminating many previous parsing errors and failures. There are
now hundreds of new test cases for different syntactic forms of
MATLAB. The known cases of MATLAB syntax that are not yet handled are
only the following:

  * user-defined classes are not yet supported at all

  * cell arrays are parsed in a limited way, and in particular, nested
    cell array references will fail

  * commas and spaces cannot be mixed in a row of an array: e.g., [1,
    2 -3 +4] will fail to parse as expected

  * comments inside arrays are discarded

  * comments after continuations are discarded

  * continuations (i.e., ...) inside strings will cause the strings to
    be mangled

  * continuations in shell commands are not handled correctly

The MATLAB parser also implements a weak, heuristic form of "kind"
analysis to try to disambiguate function calls from array references
(which in MATLAB are syntactically identical). The inability of
MOCCASIN to access the user's MATLAB environment makes it impossible
for MOCCASIN to ever be able to do full kind analysis, but the
heuristics take it very far for many use-cases in MOCCASIN's domain.

The update converter is more robust for more cases, and reports many
more errors and failures of conversion. It takes advantage of more
features of the XPP input syntax handled by BIOCHAM, allowing the
final converted SBML output to be a more faithful representation of
the input model. However, the scope of models it can convert has only
widened slightly â€“ the converter is not yet able to convert a greater
range of MATLAB models than it did before. Handling a wider range of
MATLAB inputs will require implementing solutions to such things as
handling loops, handling if statements, loading .mat files, and
converting array variables into scalar variables so that they can be
expressed in SBML (which does not yet support array variables).

Despite these limitations, the converter is able to convert
significant real-world models. As an example of the capabilities of
MOCCASIN 1.1.0, it was used to convert model BIOMD0000000608 in
BioModels Database. The original MATLAB model is 770 lines long and
the converted form has 140 SBML reactions.
